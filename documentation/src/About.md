# üíç  [Draupnir Project Templates](https://github.com/odin-arsenal/draupnir)

[Draupnir](https://github.com/odin-arsenal/draupnir) is a magical ring that symbolizes prosperity and abundance. Every ninth night, Draupnir would produce eight new rings of the same size and weight, adding to Odin‚Äôs wealth and power. This magical ring adds to the allure of Odin‚Äôs arsenal and the mythology that surrounds it.

In the same spirit, this project adds to Odin's wealth and power by scaffolding `Odin` projects.

## Odin's Arsenal

This project is part of the [Odin's Arsenal](https://github.com/odin-arsenal/).

## Why use Draupnir Templates?

These templates have in common the `project.odin` file and the `lib` directory. These are the core structures that a _Draupnir_ template requires. Following this convention, many tools can have a common standard and help the community understand quicker and better _Odin_ codebases. For example the [`Gungnir`](https://github.com/odin-arsenal/gungnir) tool can assume the codebase contains at minimum a `project.odin` file and a `lib` directory and start searching for files to document inside the `lib` directory. This convention simplifies many decisions and make tools more thoughtful and friendly.

### Where this convention comes from?

This convention takes inspiration and ideas from battle tested projects found in other languages and tools such as:

- [Elixir Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction-to-mix.html#our-first-project). Base idea for the "minimal template".
- [Phoenix Framework](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/directory_structure.html). Base idea for the "full template".
- [Gleam](https://gleam.run/writing-gleam/). Base idea for the `project.ini`.

### project.odin


### lib/

A directory that holds your application source code. It's required by the _Draupnir_ template convention.
