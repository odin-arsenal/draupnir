# [Minimal Template](minimal-template)

This project template have only the minimum directories and files needed for _Gungnir_ (`lib` and `project.odin`), so it can generate documentation. Also contains common files such as: `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig` and a sample `README.md` and `test` directory.

## When to Use?

Use this template if you want a lean starting point with just a `lib` and `project.odin` directories.
Ideal for experiments, simple applications or want to tailor the structure at will. It includes the `run` script that enables the `-collection:project=.` param, and can build `debug` and `release` versions of both `project.odin`.
